### manual-back-loaded · decision · Bootstrap/manual work back-loaded to phase 7

No agentic phase needs live secrets; apps tolerate missing Secrets (optional: true) until the trailing manual phase.

### p5-scrub-boundary-lessons · discovery · Scrubber regexes must not consume boundaries or anchor at end of line (phase 5)

Security review of the console's internal/scrub/scrub.go found two bypasses that apply equally to scripts/life_scrub.py: (1) a pattern that consumes its trailing boundary char misses the second of two ADJACENT tokens — check boundaries in code or loop until stable, test adjacent tokens; (2) a `$`-anchored, unquoted-key yaml-secret pattern misses trailing comments and JSON pairs — no end anchor, optional key quotes, value ends at whitespace/quote/comma; test both. Share fixtures with the console repo.
