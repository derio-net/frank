# Building Series Rewrite — Per-Post Changelog

All 34 building posts rewritten with the educational methodology: set-the-stage openings, narrative arcs with difficulties overcome, Mermaid diagrams, real Missteps from git history, and Frank's voice focused on teaching.

## Conventions Applied to Every Post

- **Added**: `reader_goal`, `diataxis`, `last_updated` frontmatter fields
- **Added**: "Next" link at the end of every post (except 33-hermes-shell, the finale, which links back to 00-overview)
- **Added**: Missteps table (real incidents from git history with commit references)
- **Added**: Recovery Path table (symptom → cause → fix)
- **Removed**: `{{< relref >}}` shortcodes replaced with plain `/docs/building/NN-slug` paths (Hugo build errors when linked posts are `draft: true`)
- **Removed**: MEDIA/screenshot placeholders (drafting artifacts, never captured)
- **Removed**: ASCII architecture diagrams replaced with Mermaid `flowchart LR`
- **Modified**: Chronological narrative restructured to tutorial flow (architecture → deploy → gotchas → verify → references)
- **Modified**: Verbose session narrative condensed; "I tried X then Y then Z" → "X was wrong, Y was the fix"

## Batch 1 — Posts 00–03

### 00-overview

| Category | Items |
|----------|-------|
| Added | Cover images referenced for each layer; compact 34-layer table (layer, post title, weight, operating post link) replacing prose descriptions |
| Removed | Full list of 7 tags that didn't match any existing post tag |
| Modified | Mostly kept as-is — it is a reference index, not a teaching post |

### 01-introduction

| Category | Items |
|----------|-------|
| Added | `reader_goal`, `diataxis`, `last_updated`; Mermaid diagram (operator → Talos → Omni → K8s → ArgoCD → apps); Missteps table (4 rows: USB boot, Omni VLAN, network race, power budget); Recovery Path table (4 rows) |
| Removed | ASCII art state machine (→ Mermaid); chronological firmware-log references (too granular for a tutorial) |
| Modified | Restructured from "day-by-day build log" to "Architecture → Machine choices → Network → Power → Boot → OS → GitOps → Plan" |

### 02-foundation

| Category | Items |
|----------|-------|
| Added | `reader_goal`, `diataxis`, `last_updated`; Mermaid diagram (3 Cilium LB examples); Missteps table (5 rows: Talos version naming, `apply-config` image-pull, etcd member count, Omni's missing VLAN 10, Longhorn default replica); Recovery Path table (5 rows) |
| Removed | `{{< relref >}}` to 01-introduction; the ArgoCD RBAC narrative (condensed to 1 warning box); the full "cluster bootstrap" checklist (condensed to a procedures list) |
| Modified | Restructured from chronological bootstrap to "OS → GitOps → Storage → Networking → Security → Verify" |

### 03-storage

| Category | Items |
|----------|-------|
| Added | `reader_goal`, `diataxis`, `last_updated`; Mermaid diagram (data flow: pod → PVC → Longhorn → 3 replicas); Missteps table (3 rows: fsGroup, `/var/lib/longhorn` disk, 6-day rebuild); Recovery Path table (4 rows) |
| Removed | 40-line file tree of `/var/lib/longhorn/`; 3 `{{< relref >}}` to 02-foundation |
| Modified | Expanded CSI-resizer section (ArgoCD's `replace: true` vs `fsGroup` interaction is the most non-obvious gotcha in the entire layer); restructured to "Architecture → Deploy → fsGroup → Disk → Disk Health → Backup → Verify" |
